## Solution Architecture

The application consists of two main sections:

1. **Product Dashboard** - Advanced data table with filtering, search, and column management
2. **Product Detail Pages** - Individual product views with Bento-style layout and modular component architecture

Both sections are built with performance, scalability, and maintainability in mind, following modern React and Next.js best practices.

## ✅ Requirements Compliance

### Non-negotiables Met

1. **TypeScript** ✅ - Fully implemented with strict typing throughout the application
2. **React** ✅ - Using React with modern hooks, patterns, and server components
3. **Next.js** ✅ - Built with Next.js 15.4.4 using App Router and server-side rendering
4. **Mock APIs** ✅ - Successfully integrated with `/api/products` and `/api/attributes` endpoints
5. **Provided Types** ✅ - Used exactly as specified without modifications

### Provided Enums Usage

**Complete Implementation of AttributeFieldType and AttributeGroup Enums** ✅

Successfully implemented comprehensive enum usage throughout the application as required by README.md requirement #6:

**1. Attribute Utilities (`src/utils/attribute-utils.ts`)**:

- **Field Type Input Mapping**: `getInputTypeForFieldType()` - Maps enum values to appropriate HTML input types
- **Validation Rules**: `getValidationForFieldType()` - Type-aware validation rules based on field type enum
- **Display Names**: `getFieldTypeDisplayName()` - User-friendly names for each field type
- **Visual Styling**: `getFieldTypeStyles()` - Type-specific CSS classes for visual distinction
- **Value Conversion**: `convertValueForFieldType()` - Proper data type conversion based on field type
- **Operator Selection**: `getOperatorsForFieldType()` - Valid comparison operators per field type
- **Group Organization**: `groupAttributesByGroup()` - Groups attributes using AttributeGroup enum

**2. Enhanced Components**:

- **Enhanced Attribute Card** (`src/components/product/enhanced-attribute-card.tsx`): Demonstrates proper enum usage for attribute rendering with type-aware styling
- **Attribute Enum Filter** (`src/components/attribute-enum-filter.tsx`): Filtering interface that leverages both AttributeFieldType and AttributeGroup enums
- **Enhanced Product Filters** (`src/components/enhanced-product-filters.tsx`): Advanced filtering system using enum-based validation and grouping

**3. Type-Aware Business Logic**:

- **Field Validation**: Different validation rules applied based on AttributeFieldType (number validation for NUMBER/PRICE/MEASURE, date validation for DATE/DATETIME, etc.)
- **Input Rendering**: Appropriate input types rendered based on field type enum (textarea for LONG_TEXT/RICH_TEXT, number inputs for numeric types)
- **Operator Support**: Different comparison operators available based on field type (mathematical operators for numbers, text operators for strings)
- **Grouping Logic**: Attributes organized by AttributeGroup enum for better categorization and navigation

**4. Enum Integration Examples**:

```typescript
// Field type awareness
const inputType = getInputTypeForFieldType(AttributeFieldType.NUMBER); // "number"
const displayName = getFieldTypeDisplayName(AttributeFieldType.RICH_TEXT); // "Rich Text"

// Group-based organization
const grouped = groupAttributesByGroup(attributes);
const basicInfo = grouped[AttributeGroup.BASIC_INFO];

// Type-specific validation
const operators = getOperatorsForFieldType(AttributeFieldType.PRICE);
// Returns: [{ value: "$eq", label: "Equals" }, { value: "$gt", label: "Greater Than" }, ...]
```

This implementation ensures the enums are not just type definitions but are actively used throughout the application for rendering, validation, and business logic as required. 7. **Error Management** ✅ - Comprehensive error boundaries, graceful error handling, and user feedback 8. **Observability & Web Vitals** ✅ - Web vitals tracking, custom metrics, and performance monitoring 9. **Toolchains** ✅ - ESLint configured with Next.js and TypeScript rules for code quality 10. **E2E Testing** ✅ - Complete Playwright test suite for filter functionality and CRUD operations 11. **Dockerfile** ✅ - Production-ready containerization with multi-stage builds and health checks
